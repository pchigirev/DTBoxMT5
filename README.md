This is source code of **DT-Box** - manual trading simulating tool which enhances Metatrader5 visual backtester. I wrote a series of articles describing my ideas behind the tool - [How to Become a Better Trader](https://pavelchigirev.com/how-to-become-better-trader/) as well as a detailed use-case - [DT-Box Use-Case: Transforming an Idea into a Profitable Trading Strategy](https://pavelchigirev.com/dt-box-use-case/)

The code for the DT-Box app is divided into two repositories: [DT-Box](https://github.com/pchigirev/DT-Box), which contains the Python code for the app itself, and **DT-Box MT5** (this repository), where Iâ€™ve placed all the MQL5 wrappers and the EA strategy that interacts with the app.

If you'd like to install DT-Box using pre-compiled files, here you can find all necessary information - [DT-Box: Installation and configuration](https://pavelchigirev.com/dt-box-installation-and-configuration/)
